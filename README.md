<Project 1>
1.ONNXRT_OpenVINO_CPP_sample

This project talks about how to do image processing using OpenCV modules and run inference using ONNX Runtime OpenVINO C++ APIs. A detailed step to step application is built to inference a image on a squeezenet model using OpenVINO EP.

Detailed information about this project and steps required to build and run this application is clearly mentioned in this blog.

<Docker>
we also have a docker file for cpp samples. you can use the docker file available in this repo to build the image and easily run a container to start building your CPP application.
Here's a detailed blog, how to wok with docker files using ONNXRuntime OpenVINO EP.
